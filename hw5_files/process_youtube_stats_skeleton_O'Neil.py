    Function
    --------
    process_youtube

    Use regex to create a file with records only from a specific category_id.

    Parameters
    ----------
    fn_youtube : str
        Name of YouTube trending stats file

    fn_out : str
        Name of new YouTube trending stats file containing only records of
        interest.

    Returns
    -------
    Nothing. Counts of lines matched and not matched are displayed
    at the end. For lines in category_id 28, the counts by date are captured
    in a dictionary and displayed at the end.

    -------
